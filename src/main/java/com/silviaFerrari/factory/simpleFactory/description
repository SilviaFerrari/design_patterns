CREATIONAL desgin pattern

The Simple Factory can be used when the creation of an object
involves business logic: it includes it by hiding it. It generates an instance
of an object/service for a client, but without exposing any implementation to it.

Example: we want to assemble our own custom race car.
This becomes very difficult if we have to manufacture every piece from scratch!
A good alternative is to have someone else manufacture it for us.

COMPONENTS:

FACTORY --> class with a creation method that contains a switch or if that
        chooses which class to instantiate, based on the parameters passed.
